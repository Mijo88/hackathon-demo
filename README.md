# Hackathon Project - Movies!

Fetches trending movies data upon page load. You can click on the posters
to go to that movie's specific page. Sadly I ran out of time to implement more!

External API to fetch the movie data from the server-side is https://www.themoviedb.org/

If you want to clone and run this project locally you'll need to create an API key there
and create and add it to the `.env` file in the root directory.
